## Log

### 2026-10-28 15:18 EDT — Read specification and initialize repository

- **What:** Read all 12 sections of the supplied bullet-time specification and
  inspected the previous project's ownership, devlogs, shared context, contracts,
  and Git workflow. User requested the same collaboration structure for this
  unrelated project and incremental commits with verification.
- **Observed:** Local folder initially contained only the supplied specification;
  GitHub repository was empty. Joy's existing Git identity and admin access verified.
- **Command:** `git init -b main`; configure supplied HTTPS origin; rename source
  document to `SPEC.md` without changing its bytes.
- **Source:** `Bullet-Time Learning in Video Games Research Specification.md`,
  SHA-256 `e543446ddf6466e07cbf545a402092ebe2f5d6a6a43465472bd41c4e693fb9de`.
- **Decision:** Carry over collaboration conventions only. No previous research,
  compute-host mandate, deadline, approvals, runtime pins, or results adopted.
- **Next:** Complete ownership, handoff contracts, startup/runbook, and setup checks.

### 2026-10-28 EDT — Complete collaboration documents

- **What:** Added agent startup/identity rules, working ownership and first tasks,
  draft data/exposure/run/analysis contracts, shared context, runbook, decision log,
  and a setup risk review. Created an empty attributed template for Sudarshan.
- **Code:** Initial source import committed as `13e951d`; workflow documents form
  the next cohesive commit.
- **Checks:** Read against SPEC §§4–8 and §§10–12; staged whitespace check passed.
  All implementations and contract validations remain explicitly pending.
- **Access observed:** GitHub already has a pending write invitation for
  `deephelms28`, the write collaborator on the reference repository. No invitation
  was sent or changed; acceptance and Sudarshan's own environment are not assumed.
- **Next:** Add automated scaffold checks and CI; audit all files and publish main.
